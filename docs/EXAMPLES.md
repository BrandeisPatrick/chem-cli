üöÄ Next Steps

Please choose your preferred precision level by typing one of:
- `run full` - Maximum accuracy (may take hours/days)
- `run half` - Balanced accuracy and speed (recommended) 
- `run low` - Quick preview (minutes to hours)

I'll then generate all the input files and commands needed to run your calculation!
```

**User:** "2" or "run half"

**ChemCLI Response:**
```
üéâ Calculation Setup Complete!

I've generated all the files needed for your HALF precision calculation:

üìã Generated Files:
- `research_plan.md` - Detailed theoretical background
- `execution_plan.md` - Software and method selection
- `run_plan.md` - Complete execution instructions
- `input.inp` - Ready-to-run input file
- `job.sh` - Job submission script

üöÄ Next Steps:
1. Review the generated plans in the `plans/` directory
2. Run the calculation using the commands in `run_plan.md`
3. Monitor progress and analyze results

Estimated runtime: 1-4 hours
Expected accuracy: ¬±0.2-0.4 eV vs experiment

Good luck with your calculation! üß™‚ú®

## File Outputs

When you run a calculation, ChemCLI generates:

1. **research_plan.md** - Theoretical background and method justification
2. **execution_plan.md** - Software selection and computational setup
3. **run_plan.md** - Step-by-step execution instructions
4. **Input files** - Ready-to-run calculation inputs (`.inp`, `.in`, etc.)
5. **Job scripts** - Batch submission scripts for clusters

## Tips

- Be specific about molecules: "benzene", "C6H6", "c1ccccc1"
- Mention solvation if needed: "in water", "in acetone"
- Ask for comparisons: "compare B3LYP vs CAM-B3LYP"
- Request specific properties: "dipole moment", "oscillator strengths"

## Special Commands

- `help` - Show help information
- `status` - Check system and software status
- `clear` - Clear screen and restart
- `exit` - Exit ChemCLI

## Testing the Implementation

Run the workflow test:
```bash
node test_workflow.js
```

This will test:
